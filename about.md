Hello! I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Epidemiology in the Infectious Disease Track. I've been living in Baltimore since 2016 with my family and we love it. My research focus is on optimizing active case finding strategies for tuberculosis (TB). I have over ten years of experience working on international health programs and research. Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Research Program Manager at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine working on TB cohort studies and trials in India. 

### Statistics, Programming and Data Analysis Experience

I took the 620 biostat series at JHSPH about 5 years ago and have led a few analyses of longitudinal cohort data since then. I am most comfortable in stata but recently started learning R in the Infectious Disease Dynamics course. I often feel frustrated with R but am determined to get more comfortable, particularly so that I can generate beautiful graphics and generate tables for papers and monitoring and evaluation reports. I always say that I'm a weak coder but it's time to finally build those skills more!

### Fun facts: 

1. I'm happiest when I'm outside in the woods!
1. I have a daughter who will be 4 in November.
1. I met my husband in Tajikistan.
1. I live in a house that was built in 1850.
1. I am half Swiss and half Iranian. 

## Interesting facts about TB

I've been working on TB programs and research since 2014. TB is a curable disease that 1.5 million people still die of each year! Check out the [**WHO Global TB Report**](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240037021) for tons of interesting data and facts about TB.
